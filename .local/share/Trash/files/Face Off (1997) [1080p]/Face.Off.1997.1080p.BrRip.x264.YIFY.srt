2
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:36,486
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

3
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:40,907
Hey, look, what is this, a picnic?
Come on. Let's go, man.
We got ten minutes to go.

4
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,751
- Punch me out, man.
- You got it.

5
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:35,545
Any word from the LAPD intelligence,
if there is such a thing?

6
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,131
- Not yet, sir.
- Of course not.

7
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:42,135
Because we're a covert
anti-terrorism team that is so secret...

8
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,220
that when we snap our fingers
nothin' happens!

9
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:58,067
Sheriff's department?
Airport police?

10
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,987
Still waiting. But lnterpol
insists he's in Tripoli.

11
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:04,657
Yeah, well, you-you trust-- You trust
that billion-dollar satellite, okay?

12
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,827
l'll trust a ten-dollar snitch
at this point.

13
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:12,206
- Sean, look--
- What?

14
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,084
Why don't you just give 'em
a little break, okay?

15
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:18,921
We'll take a break
when the case breaks, okay?

16
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,846
Hallelujah

17
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:31,017
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

18
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:33,060
Hallelujah

19
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,771
Hallelujah, hallelujah

20
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:41,027
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

21
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,945
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelujah

22
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:47,116
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

23
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:50,953
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelu-- Hallelu-- Hallelujah

24
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,043
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

25
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,880
Hallelujah

26
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:05,384
- And he shall reign for ever and ever
- l never really enjoyed The Messiah.

27
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,638
- ln fact, l think it's fucking boring.
- And he shall reign for ever and ever

28
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:13,810
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

29
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,648
Hallelujah, hallelujah

30
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:20,900
Hallelujah, hallelujah

31
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,152
Hallelujah

32
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,488
Hallelujah, hallelujah

33
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:32,995
Hallelujah

34
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,082
Victor-- When we--
When we put this thing to bed,

35
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,668
y-you can brand
the Fourth Amendment on my butt.

36
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:42,338
- Thank you.
- Sir, excuse me.
Your wife is on line one.

37
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:46,092
Sean! A jet was just chartered.
Anderson Airfield.

38
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,845
Guess who paid the bill in cash?
Pollux Troy.

39
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,848
- Put one of our people on that plane.
- Wait! We still got no sign of Castor!

40
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:55,935
Pollux doesn't fly without
Big Brother. Now come on!

41
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:40,563
You're 26 minutes late.
The casing didn't fit, right?

42
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,566
Yeah, l told you goddam Dietrich
would try to pawn off some...

43
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,735
cheap-shit North Korean plastic.

44
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,905
Casing fit like a condom.

45
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,408
You didn't deviate
from the plan, did you, Pollux?

46
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,244
Well, how long did you want me
to sit here twiddling my thumbs?

47
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:59,081
l paid for the jet.
Save us some time.

48
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:03,669
That's what the boys are for,
to hide our famous faces.

49
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,681
lf l didn't love you so damn
much, l'd have to kill you, bro.

50
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:18,518
l hate it when you
call me bro.

51
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,529
You guys are paid
to protect him from everybody,

52
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,948
including himself.

53
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:36,619
And stay away from downtown on the 18th.
lt's gonna be a little, um, smoggy.

54
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,874
Okay, my passengers are here.
l gotta go.

55
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,966
Let's go. Let's go.
l'm bored. Let's go.

56
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,802
- Here you go.
- Bravo.

57
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,721
Would you like anything else
once we're airborne?

58
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,974
Oh, a peach.

59
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:02,812
Sit. Come here.

60
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:10,903
You know, l can, uh,
eat a peach for hours.

61
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,242
Um, come here.

62
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:20,997
lf l were to send you flowers,
where would l, uh--

63
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,583
No, wait. Let me rephrase.

64
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:28,087
lf l were to let you
suck my tongue,

65
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,258
would you be grateful?

66
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,948
There's someone on the runway.

67
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:02,121
Get off of me!

68
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,554
- Archer.
- FBl!

69
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:28,231
This is a very big gun.
Fly the fuckin' plane!

70
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,570
Come on. That's it.

71
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:42,203
- Come on. Let's go!
- Goddam it. Don't play chicken
with a goddam jet!

72
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:48,167
Come on.

73
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:58,219
- He's got Winters! Goddam it!
- Damn it, Sean!

74
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,357
All units, pin 'em in!

75
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,361
Close in on 'em!

76
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:24,120
One of yours, Sean?

77
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:27,874
Shit!

78
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:44,724
Out. Come on. Go, go!

79
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,978
Goddam it, Sean!

80
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,993
Take off now.

81
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,168
- Fly!
- l can't!

82
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,837
Fly, bitch!

83
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,852
All units, locked and ready.
Follow Archer's lead.

84
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,781
What the fuck are you doing?

85
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:45,034
There's an engine out.
We gotta stop.

86
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,499
- Move, move, move!
- Get back! Back up!

87
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,451
Pollux!

88
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,706
- Cas!
- Get over here.

89
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,627
Back him to me.
Back him to me. He's mine!

90
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,058
Cas.

91
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,980
Secure the hangar.

92
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,092
Berkley, down!

93
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:23,025
Down!

94
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:09,071
Give up, Castor. Your time's up.

95
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,744
Well, you better hit me, Sean,
'cause you only got one bullet left.

96
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,580
So do you.

97
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:22,335
Wow. We've got
something in common.

98
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,754
We both know our guns.

99
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:29,675
What we don't have in common is that
l don't care if l live, and you do.

100
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:33,679
Sean, that hurts.

101
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:36,349
You're not having
any fun, are you, Sean?

102
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:39,185
Why don't you come with us?
Try terrorism for hire?

103
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,854
- We'll blow some shit up.
lt's more fun.
- Shut the fuck up.

104
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,607
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

105
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:48,945
l'm about to unleash
the biblical plague "Hell-A" deserves,

106
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:51,614
but l'll give this shithole
a break if my brother and l walk.

107
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:56,035
- Bullshit.
- Oh-Oh no, l-l see, l see.
Y-You think l'm bluffing.

108
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:59,539
Maybe l am.
But, then, maybe l'm not.

109
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,958
More importantly, what would
you do with me locked up?

110
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,377
You'd drive your wife
and kid crazy.

111
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,546
Say, how is your daughter,
anyway? ls she ripening by now?

112
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:09,215
Your-- Your darling Janie,
your little peach?

113
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:12,051
ls she ripe?

114
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:16,639
Okay.

115
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:19,058
O-Okay.

116
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,394
Policeman, don't shoot me.

117
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:26,315
l'm scared, Seanie!

118
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,487
Well, l think you better pull
the trigger,

119
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:33,573
because l don't give a fuck!

120
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,992
l'm ready

121
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,912
Ready for the big ride, baby

122
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:12,278
Well, Sean, looks like
Elvis done left the buildin'.

123
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:28,711
lt wasn't my fault.
Why won't you ever be on my side?

124
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:32,048
l am always on your side,
but you have to give me a chance--

125
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,467
Now what?

126
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:37,637
She was suspended again. Some kid
made a crack about her clothes--

127
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:40,723
- She started a fight.
- That's right, Dad.
Don't even ask me what happened.

128
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,559
Okay. What happened?

129
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:53,486
- Ah, l see.
- Not like you would believe me anyway.

130
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,155
Jamie, look,
it-it-it's not easy, okay?

131
00:18:56,322 --> 00:19:00,493
l mean, loo-- You change the way
you look every week.

132
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:05,123
And-And the way you act.
Who are you supposed to be now?

133
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,500
l'm supposed to be me.

134
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,129
Not like you have a clue
who l am anyway.

135
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:21,430
l have to work tonight.

136
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:25,434
l called to tell you,
but l was on hold for ten minutes,
and l couldn't wait any longer.

137
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,688
l got him, Eve.

138
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:33,985
lt's over.

139
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,070
lt's over.

140
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,575
Oh, Sean.

141
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,248
l'll make it up to you
and Jamie. l promise.

142
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:51,627
l'll put in for a desk job--
Well, l'll-- l'll do counselling,
sit down, talk about Mike--

143
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,880
l'll do it, anything you want.

144
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,675
l just want you.

145
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,553
Well, good, 'cause that's
what you're gonna get.

146
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,555
You happy?

147
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,891
Yes. Yeah.

148
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:36,255
What is all this?

149
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:41,344
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

150
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:44,597
l didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

151
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,933
No, wait.

152
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:51,354
How about, uh--

153
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:54,190
What about to Anderson,
Montgomery,

154
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:56,442
Berkley,

155
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:02,782
Pincus, Gianelli, Winters--

156
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,865
How's Loomis?

157
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,660
Uh, he's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh,

158
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:50,663
he'll be okay.

159
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,791
- What's up?
- Special ops. They want a word.

160
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,002
Aw, forget it.
l don't have the time.

161
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:59,088
Better make time, Sean.

162
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,507
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

163
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,676
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

164
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:24,197
Porcelain casing.

165
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:26,199
Thermal cloak.

166
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:29,368
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

167
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,621
lt's enough to flatten
a square mile.

168
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:34,373
Then depending on
the prevailing winds,

169
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:39,462
the fallout'll be a tad worse
than Gulf War syndrome.

170
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:44,091
A biblical--
A biblical plague to LA.

171
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:48,387
Where is he?
Where is Pollux Troy?

172
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,978
Why draw the schematic if you're
not gonna build the bomb?

173
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:58,981
What, is it now a crime
in this country to exercise the mind?

174
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:03,236
- l'm interested in bomb--
- l won't say another word
until l see my brother.

175
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,490
Any progress?

176
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:10,326
- l need about ten minutes alone
with this guy.
- Ah, give it a rest.

177
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:12,745
You got Castor. Just go home.

178
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:15,164
Look, we're not gonna evacuate
the city on your hunch.

179
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:18,334
Look, l know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

180
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:23,422
You know what, just-just run
the goddam bureau any way you like.

181
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:36,269
l could put an agent in his cell.
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

182
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:40,106
Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

183
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:43,693
The only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is his brother, and he's dead.

184
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:47,780
There is one other possibility.

185
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:16,726
Oh, God.
You're keeping him alive.

186
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:20,062
Relax, Archer. He's a turnip.

187
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:24,734
Oh.

188
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,154
What if you could walk
into Erewhon Prison...

189
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:32,575
and give Pollux a nice, big
brotherly hug as Castor Troy?

190
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:36,496
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

191
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:39,999
Let me try. Malcolm Walsh.

192
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,668
- l run the bio-cover unit
for special ops.
- l know who you are.

193
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,254
- But you don't know what l can do.
- Uh--

194
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:48,341
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

195
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:52,595
Dr Walsh can alter the likeness,
even the voice of a government witness.

196
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:55,681
l think you'll recognize
this patient.

197
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:02,688
We had to build your friend Loomis
a whole new ear from scratch.

198
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:15,535
What we're suggesting for you, Archer,
isn't a permanent transplant like that,

199
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:18,621
just a temporary trade.

200
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:20,623
Come here.

201
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:27,296
With the new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

202
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:29,632
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

203
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,635
Height difference is negligible.

204
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:39,225
Skin pigment, eye pigment:
both almost identical.

205
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:44,647
We'll use laser shears for the hairline,
microplugs for body hair.

206
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:49,652
We'll do an abdominoplasti--
take care of those, uh, love handles.

207
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,656
But all that's the easy part.
Here's the real science.

208
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:57,243
This is a state-of-the-art,
morphogenetic template.

209
00:25:57,326 --> 00:26:00,496
The inside is modeled
on your skull,

210
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:03,082
the outside exactly like Troy's.

211
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:07,086
Then we fit his face on top.
Not a replica, but the real thing.

212
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,922
Then we simply connect the muscles,
tear ducts and nerve endings.

213
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:13,092
- So, you wanna take his face and mine--
- Borrow.

214
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,678
The procedure's
completely reversible.

215
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,598
Y-You think that l want
to do this?

216
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,933
- No. No.
- There's no one else, Sean.

217
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:24,437
- No!
- You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

218
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,606
l'll get his gang to talk.
That's what l do.

219
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:31,778
What if you can't? The bomb will blow,
and Castor Troy will win.

220
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:38,284
Get out. Go ahead.
Wipe your ass.

221
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:40,369
Damn, what the hell is
that smell?

222
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:44,290
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

223
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:49,295
Hello, Sasha. When was the last
time you saw Castor Troy?

224
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,631
- Who cares? He's dead.
- Answer the question.

225
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:54,300
l know my rights. l don't have
to answer shit.

226
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,385
You're right, but know this:

227
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:59,972
You're a convicted felon on probation
for harbouring Castor Troy.

228
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:03,643
One phone call from me, and your son
will end up in a foster home.

229
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:12,068
l understand why
you would use such a threat.

230
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:14,904
But you try to take him away
from me, l swear to you--

231
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,412
l haven't seen him for years.

232
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,930
This reeks of you. lt's got
your signature all over it.

233
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:47,854
Maybe, but you ain't got nothin'
on me and you know it.

234
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,024
Maybe so, but l can keep you
within city limits,

235
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:54,193
or l can talk
to your sister again.

236
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,113
She's right outside.

237
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,866
Only this time l'll be nice.

238
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:03,619
Hey, Sean,

239
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:06,038
how's your dead son?

240
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:19,385
l don't know any--
Okay, okay, l heard somethin'
about the 18th, but that's all l know.

241
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:32,148
Great. So we got a date.
Now where the hell's the damn bomb?

242
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:34,567
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

243
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,153
lt's your call, Sean.

244
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,407
- Does Lazarro know your plan?
- No, this is a black bag operation.

245
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:46,329
Strictly off the books. You can't tell
Lazarro, and you can't tell your wife.

246
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, God.

247
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,754
What are you asking me to do?
Okay, let's see.

248
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:58,508
You're asking me to--
to break the law,

249
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:01,427
risk my neck.

250
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:04,597
And you're asking me to put
in the dark all the people...

251
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:06,849
that love me...

252
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,851
and trust me.

253
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,279
l'll do it.

254
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,989
Sean.

255
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:05,992
Sorry l woke you.

256
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,662
l'm glad it's you that woke me.

257
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:12,582
And not a phone call telling me
you won't be coming home.

258
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:17,003
But that's a fear l can
finally let go of, huh?

259
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,517
Oh, it's all right, Sean.
lt's okay.

260
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:36,022
l keep--

261
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:39,192
l keep wanting to move this...

262
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:41,694
over here, you know?

263
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:45,448
lf it had only been an--
an inch to the left,

264
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:49,035
Mikey'd be alive.

265
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:53,623
And you wouldn't be.

266
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,876
Sean, things are gonna get
better now that you're home.

267
00:30:57,043 --> 00:31:01,214
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

268
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:05,718
Everything will be better
now that he is forever out of our lives.

269
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:19,732
Eve, if l told you
that l realize that--

270
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:22,151
that this thing
won't fully end...

271
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:27,490
u-until l did one last thing--

272
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:31,577
Eve, something vital.

273
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:38,084
Okay-- l-- You're going
back on assignment again.

274
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:41,587
This one last time.

275
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,258
Come on, Eve.

276
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:52,932
"l'm going anywhere,"
that's what you told me.

277
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:54,934
Oh.

278
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,277
You don't need me to tell you
what to do, Sean. You never have. So go.

279
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:07,613
But go now.

280
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:38,394
Sean, l changed my mind.
This is a suicide mission.

281
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,730
Yeah, l know, l know.

282
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:47,153
You know, maybe this, uh--
this doctor-- if he-- if he--

283
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,740
lf he can do even half
of what he says he can do,

284
00:32:50,907 --> 00:32:53,826
maybe it'll work, l don't know.

285
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:56,496
l'd become Castor Troy,
be in control.

286
00:32:56,662 --> 00:32:58,998
That's the part that scares me.

287
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:07,507
Doctor, l have, uh, something--

288
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:10,760
l have this scar-- that-- that--

289
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:15,848
that if you can p-put this back
after, after all this is over--

290
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:18,184
lt-- lt's important to me.
lt's-- lt's like a reminder.

291
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,770
Sure.

292
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:29,028
Tito, please,
hold this for me. Please.

293
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:34,951
Okay. Let's go.

294
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:47,690
Oh, G--

295
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,338
Oh, my God.

296
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,662
Hey, you okay? Come on.
Talk to me, Sean.

297
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,675
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

298
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:21,969
- Sean! Sean!
- Fuck you!

299
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:25,848
Sean, come on. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

300
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:28,518
Sean! Sean! Archer!

301
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:31,187
You're Sean Archer.

302
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:35,274
Sean Archer. Sean Archer.

303
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:44,951
When this is over,
l want you to take this face...

304
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,412
and burn it.

305
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:52,542
Hey. l still
sound like me.

306
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:59,841
l've implanted a microchip
on your larynx. lt's fantastic,
but you'll have to be careful.

307
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:03,803
Pressure, sharp blow,
even a violent sneeze could dislodge it.

308
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,975
- Just repeat what you hear.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

309
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:12,395
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

310
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:16,315
There's a scratchy tickle.

311
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:20,903
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

312
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:26,033
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

313
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:34,917
- Once again.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

314
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:40,506
- Perfect.
- Now, Sean, six days until the 18th.

315
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:43,801
The clock's ticking,
and so is the bomb.

316
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:03,196
You got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

317
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:08,117
Either way, Miller comes in,
pulls you out. You got me?

318
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:15,291
- What's the matter?
- Face itches.

319
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:21,631
You all right?
Come on. Let's go.

320
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,221
Archer's gonna be pissed when he comes
back from his training op and finds out.

321
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:31,057
The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

322
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:27,447
You are now the property
of Erewhon Prison,

323
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,450
a citizen of nowhere.

324
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:33,661
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

325
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,956
Amnesty lnternational
doesn't know we exist.

326
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,376
When l say
your ass belongs to me,

327
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,879
l mean exactly that.

328
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,475
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

329
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:58,311
The boots tell us where you are.

330
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:01,272
621 to Population!

331
00:42:19,725 --> 00:42:24,147
H-H-Hey, what's the matter, pal?
Don't you remember the little people?

332
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:28,734
- Burke Hicks.
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:31,821
l bust--

334
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:34,991
believe Sean Archer busted you
for stalkin' the UN Secretary General.

335
00:42:35,116 --> 00:42:38,953
Oh, no. Archer framed me.
l ain't had nothin' to do with that.

336
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:41,330
No-- Word was you got wasted.

337
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,675
You wanna see what wasted
looks like, little man?

338
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:58,848
Pollux.

339
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:15,323
Yeah!

340
00:43:21,788 --> 00:43:24,957
Out of the way. Central,
there's a disturbance in the population.

341
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,794
- Go to lockdown.
- Hold that lockdown.

342
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:49,857
Come on, you pussy!

343
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:57,657
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

344
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,576
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

345
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:14,006
'Cause l'm Castor Troy! Yeah!

346
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,427
l'm Castor Troy!

347
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:21,764
- Castor! Castor!
- l'm Castor Troy!

348
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah! Yeah!

349
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,023
Yeah!

350
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:01,804
Lock 'em down.

351
00:45:11,814 --> 00:45:15,151
l stop the fights, not you.

352
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:22,408
That's two strikes for you, Dubov.
One more, you know where you're goin'.

353
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,495
- When l get out of here--
- lf you get out of here--

354
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:30,333
l'm gonna have you fired.

355
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:51,164
Lars, it's me.

356
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:54,417
Believe it.

357
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:57,003
Someone--

358
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,923
They took-- switched my-- wh--

359
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,176
F-- Some fucking--

360
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:09,932
But it's cool.
We're gonna deal with it.

361
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:21,360
Oh, yes, we're gonna deal
with it.

362
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:54,227
- What's this about?
- Dr Walsh.

363
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,563
l was just, uh, enjoying some
of your greatest hits here.

364
00:47:57,647 --> 00:48:00,566
Oh-Oh, l hope you don't mind.
l-l, uh, l partook...

365
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:03,569
of your groovy, uh--
your groovy painkillers.

366
00:48:03,736 --> 00:48:08,658
You know, this is fabulous work.
This is-- This is-- Oh, bravo.

367
00:48:10,076 --> 00:48:12,995
Bra-fucking-vo.

368
00:48:13,162 --> 00:48:17,166
Oh, God. This is excellent.
Bravo.

369
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,752
- Bravo.
- What do you want?

370
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:28,344
Take one goddam guess.

371
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:40,106
l wish they'd play some of those
salmon spawning scenes again.
l found them intensely erotic.

372
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,776
Fuckin' nature channel.

373
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:47,613
One more waterfall,
l'm gonna foam at the mouth.

374
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:51,033
lt's like
they're begging us to riot.

375
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,035
Excuse me.

376
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:59,709
Not feeling very coordinated
lately, are you?

377
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:06,966
Look, bro, you gotta help me.

378
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,969
l am so fried.

379
00:49:10,136 --> 00:49:15,558
lf the psychos in here
find out l'm misfiring,
we're both gonna be dead meat.

380
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:17,977
Shock treatment?
What's the matter with you?

381
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:20,229
Did they operate?

382
00:49:20,396 --> 00:49:24,066
l was in a coma. Jesus, you're
still so fuckin' paranoid.

383
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:26,068
Aren't they giving you
your medication in here?

384
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:28,738
What was my medication?

385
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:36,496
Pollux, l hand-fed you
those pills for years.

386
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:39,582
Vivex. l haven't forgotten that.

387
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:42,502
lt's just everything else.
lt's--

388
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:46,589
senses, my reflexes, my memory.

389
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:50,343
lt's like a tab of bad Quantrex.

390
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,847
l don't even know why that fucking Yeti
jumped me yesterday.

391
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:57,183
Dubov?

392
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:02,522
You had a sex sandwich with his wife and
his sister the night he was sent here.

393
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:06,526
l guess that explains
why he's so upset.

394
00:50:06,692 --> 00:50:08,611
Wow.

395
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:14,367
We're gonna blow up LA, bro.
Ain't it cool?

396
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:17,036
Oh, right. Rub my nose
in it, why don't you?

397
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:22,625
$10 million design, and now those
militia nutjobs get to keep their cash.

398
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,710
lt's so fucking unfair.

399
00:50:26,212 --> 00:50:30,216
That bomb you built
does deserve an audience.

400
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:32,635
lt's a work of art.

401
00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:35,138
lt belongs in the Louvre.

402
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:39,225
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

403
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:42,478
l guess the LA Convention
Centre'll have to do.

404
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:54,657
- What?
- Thank you.

405
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:56,576
For what?

406
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,663
You are so fucking pathetic.

407
00:51:18,514 --> 00:51:20,600
You got a visitor.

408
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:30,753
Ooh-wee, you good-lookin'.
You're hot!

409
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,010
lt's like looking
in a mirror, only not.

410
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:46,018
- Troy?
- Now that is between us, okay?

411
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:49,689
- But you were--
- ln a coma?

412
00:52:49,856 --> 00:52:54,360
Nothing like having your face
cut off to disturb your sleep.
Read the newspaper lately?

413
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:02,952
- You killed them?
- Well, beats paying the bill, huh?

414
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,706
Come on. l mean, uh, if
a face-lift costs five grand--

415
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:09,542
See anything you like?

416
00:53:15,214 --> 00:53:16,883
Tito.

417
00:53:26,976 --> 00:53:29,812
l torched all the evidence
that proves you're you, okay?

418
00:53:29,979 --> 00:53:34,734
So, wow, looks like you're gonna be
in here for the next hundred years!

419
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,655
Now, l have got to go.

420
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:45,244
l've got a government job to
abuse and a lonely wife to fuck.

421
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:47,914
Oh, did l say that?
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't say that.

422
00:53:47,997 --> 00:53:50,166
Make love to.

423
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:53,002
Oh, God, l miss that face.

424
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:57,590
Die!

425
00:53:57,757 --> 00:54:00,760
Die!

426
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:11,854
- Sorry, Agent Archer.
- No, don't you worry about it,
Mr Walton.

427
00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:15,274
Clearly he's, uh, had
a traumatic childhood,

428
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,860
and, uh, thank you.

429
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:24,784
What's givin' you the will
to live is lookin' for revenge

430
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:30,289
Look at this place. l'm in hell.

431
00:54:30,456 --> 00:54:33,126
l may never get
a hard-on again.

432
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:40,883
Don't lose your head

433
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:50,476
Oh, yes.

434
00:54:50,643 --> 00:54:52,812
There we go.

435
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:14,750
Well, l suppose it was only a matter of
time before you forgot where we lived.

436
00:55:15,918 --> 00:55:18,171
Come on. Give me a break.

437
00:55:18,337 --> 00:55:23,509
Every house in this block looks
the same. Then l spotted you.

438
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:25,678
Eve.

439
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,514
My one and only Eve.

440
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:31,267
So how was your
vital assignment?

441
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:34,020
Which one was that?

442
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:37,190
How should l know, Sean?

443
00:55:37,273 --> 00:55:41,444
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yes. The, um--
the out of body experience.

444
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:43,696
Yes. That one.

445
00:55:45,198 --> 00:55:49,035
- Where you goin'?
- To the hospital.

446
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:53,539
- No. No. What's the matter?
- Sean, come on.

447
00:55:53,706 --> 00:55:56,709
- Oh, what?
- Quit teasing me. Stop it.
l'm still really hurt, okay?

448
00:55:56,876 --> 00:55:59,962
- There are leftovers in the fridge.
- No, no.

449
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:03,800
l want to stay hungry
for you, my peach.

450
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:06,135
- Give me that tongue.
- Sean, come on.

451
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,971
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What does Evie want?

452
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:13,643
Eve, l hate to see you go,
but l love to watch you leave.

453
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:49,595
"Date night fizzled again.

454
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,432
We haven't made love
in two months."

455
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,435
What a loser.

456
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:01,858
Come here, sister

457
00:57:02,024 --> 00:57:05,611
- Papa's in the swing
- Got your E-mail, Karl.

458
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:08,781
- The poem you sent me was pretty kinky.
- He ain't too hip

459
00:57:08,948 --> 00:57:12,618
About that new-breed babe

460
00:57:12,702 --> 00:57:16,372
- The plot thickens.
- He ain't no drag

461
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:21,127
- Papa's got a brand new bag
- Hang on a second.

462
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:23,963
- Come here, Mama
- l'll have to call you back.

463
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,550
- And dig this crazy scene
- You're not respecting my boundaries.

464
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:31,471
- l'm coming in, Janie.
- He's not too fancy
- Janie?

465
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:35,725
- But this line is pretty clean
- l don't think you heard me, Jamie.

466
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:38,895
- He ain't no drag
- You got something that l crave.

467
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:41,731
Papa's got a brand new bag

468
00:57:43,983 --> 00:57:47,153
He's doin' the jerk
He's doin' the fly

469
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,655
- Don't play him cheap
'cause you know he ain't shy
- Clarissa left those here.

470
00:57:49,822 --> 00:57:52,658
- Well, l won't tell Mom
if you don't.
- He's doin' the Monkey

471
00:57:52,742 --> 00:57:55,745
- The Mashed Potato, Jump-back Jack
- When did you start smoking?

472
00:57:55,912 --> 00:58:01,501
- See you later, alligator
- You'll be seeing a lot
of changes around here.

473
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:05,922
- Papa's in the swing
- Papa's got a brand new bag. Ow!

474
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:09,008
He ain't too hip now

475
00:58:09,092 --> 00:58:13,179
- But l can dig that new breed
- l can do the j-- do the s--

476
00:58:13,346 --> 00:58:16,766
He's doin' the twist
just like this

477
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:36,285
Bye, bro.
Drop me a line sometime.

478
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:42,041
Gonna be kind of lonely
with Pollux gone, huh?

479
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,210
Po-- Pollux what?

480
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:48,548
That big-shit cop, Archer, cut him
a deal for turnin' state's evidence.

481
00:58:48,714 --> 00:58:51,634
Your brother's been released.

482
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:58,641
l'm Sean Archer. There is a bomb
at the LA Convention Centre.

483
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:01,227
l'm Sean Archer and-- Ow!

484
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:20,246
Tiramisu, tiramisu

485
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:26,586
- Sir, we just wanted you to know--
- We're all really sorry about Tito.

486
00:59:26,753 --> 00:59:29,422
Oh, hey, shit happens, you know?

487
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:32,258
So is our star witness talking?

488
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:36,262
Yeah. About what kind of mustard
he likes on his tongue sandwiches.

489
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:40,266
lf that bomb is out there,
we're almost out of time.

490
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:42,435
Archer!

491
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:47,690
You made the deal with Pollux Troy.
That isn't like you.

492
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:51,444
Well, when all else fails,
fresh tactics.

493
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:53,529
Fresh? Well, let me tell you
my fresh tactic.

494
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:57,283
From now on everything to do with
this case goes through me, understood?

495
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,869
Good. Thanks.

496
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:16,719
You're supposed to be snitching
and making me look good.

497
01:00:16,886 --> 01:00:20,056
- Look good?
- Mm-hmm.

498
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:24,644
Seeing that face on you makes me afraid
my tiramisu might come back up.

499
01:00:24,727 --> 01:00:29,816
Well, think about me. This nose.
This hair. This ridiculous chin.

500
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:33,736
Brother, we're going straight.

501
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:37,824
Oh, my goodness. Did you
exchange brains as well?

502
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,994
The first thing l need you to confess to
is the location of the bomb.

503
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:43,996
What about our $10 million?

504
01:00:44,163 --> 01:00:49,168
What about when l become
an American hero for defusing
the bomb? What's that worth?

505
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:52,755
Know that. Thank you.
Next question.

506
01:00:56,592 --> 01:01:00,263
- You're not the only one
in the family with brains.
- No.

507
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,267
- Although now l am
the only one with the looks.
- Touche.

508
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:08,855
This is an emergency evacuation.

509
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:13,943
This is an emergency evacuation.

510
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:17,780
Let's go. Police. Go! Go!

511
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:35,047
- Any ideas?
- Yeah, run.

512
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:39,552
Sir, it's protected by a tamper switch,
and it'll take us hours to bypass.

513
01:01:42,138 --> 01:01:45,558
- Evacuate your team, Captain.
- No, but, sir, we can't--
we can't disarm.

514
01:01:45,641 --> 01:01:47,560
Leave.

515
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:10,082
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

516
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,418
Hallelujah

517
01:02:12,502 --> 01:02:15,671
Ha-Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

518
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:25,264
Oh, baby. Oh--

519
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:31,687
That was the scene
at the LA Convention Centre,

520
01:02:31,854 --> 01:02:34,857
where an FBl agent became
a city saviour.

521
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:40,780
Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just
one second before it was set to blow.

522
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:45,535
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices
scheduled to speak here today...

523
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:48,788
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

524
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:53,626
We asked Agent Archer if the FBl had
any leads on who planted the device.

525
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:56,379
Well, that is, uh,
classified information.

526
01:02:56,546 --> 01:03:00,633
But if he-- lf he's listening,
l wouldn't mind giving him a message:

527
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,970
lnterception. Now our side's got
the ball. Sorry.

528
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,766
Wanda? Everybody.

529
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:55,688
Hey, look, l--
l wanna thank you for, uh,

530
01:03:55,855 --> 01:04:01,360
enduring all these years
that l was an insufferable bore.

531
01:04:01,444 --> 01:04:04,197
Sir, did you just have
a surgical procedure?

532
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:07,867
- What do you mean?
- Well, was the stick...

533
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,787
successfully removed
from your ass?

534
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:17,293
Sir. The White House on one.

535
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,962
lt's the president.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

536
01:04:20,129 --> 01:04:22,632
- Well, you tell the president to hold.
- Okay.

537
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:56,749
- l got it.
- Sean, you scared the hell out of me.

538
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:59,752
- lt's date night.
- Oh, my God.

539
01:04:59,836 --> 01:05:02,338
Oh, congratulations.

540
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:04,757
Oh, big deal.

541
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,430
Okay, l said, uh,
"Mr President,

542
01:05:10,596 --> 01:05:13,266
"l want the authority...

543
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:15,768
"and l want the funds
and the personnel...

544
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:19,021
to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism," right?

545
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:26,779
And he said, "The next name
on my calling list is Lazarro,

546
01:05:26,946 --> 01:05:32,452
and l'm telling him that Sean Archer
writes his own ticket," okay?

547
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:37,540
What's the matter?

548
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:39,709
l-- l don't know, Sean.
You just--

549
01:05:39,876 --> 01:05:44,797
You just seem so different.
l mean, what is th-- all this about?

550
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:49,469
What-- This intimate
candlelight dinner? Huh?

551
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:52,889
And l'm supposed to forget
all the promises 'cause
you're going back into the fray?

552
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:16,996
lf the top cop in this country
can't come home...

553
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:22,085
every night to his wife,
then the hell with the country.

554
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:27,340
Because the only place
l'm going is upstairs with you.

555
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:46,025
Exercise. One hour.

556
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:58,704
How can l get out of here?

557
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:00,873
You can't.

558
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,876
How can l get these boots off?

559
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,212
They only take 'em off
in the clinic.

560
01:07:06,379 --> 01:07:08,631
Right before
they fry your skull.

561
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,394
Hey.

562
01:07:23,813 --> 01:07:26,816
- l'm out of cigarettes.
- Get back in line, Troy.

563
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:31,988
l said l'm out of cigarettes.

564
01:07:39,745 --> 01:07:41,831
Kick his ass!

565
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,589
Hey, what the hell!
That's not right!

566
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:02,935
l need a light! l need a light!

567
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:05,188
- Anybody got a light?
- All right!

568
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:08,775
Anybody got a light?
Got a light?

569
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:24,123
You better bring the bastard down
before he chokes himself to death.

570
01:08:40,723 --> 01:08:43,810
Well, happy day,
it's Castor Troy.

571
01:08:47,313 --> 01:08:50,817
Wait. H-Hold it, hold it.
Can l, uh-- Can l have a light?

572
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,069
You know, those things'll kill you.

573
01:08:54,237 --> 01:08:56,989
Get his boots, Walton.

574
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:07,083
Dubov, l didn't touch your wife.

575
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:11,003
And l didn't touch your sister.

576
01:09:11,129 --> 01:09:15,758
But l know your wife loves you,
is waiting for you.

577
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:18,177
So let's get out of here.

578
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:20,430
You're more brain-dead than Dubov.

579
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:28,771
- Out.
- Out.

580
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:31,524
- Get him!
- Grab his arms!

581
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:33,776
Look out!

582
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:44,537
Shots have been fired.
We have men down in C-4.

583
01:09:44,662 --> 01:09:47,165
- l got 'em.
- Throw 'em down!

584
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:07,351
Move!

585
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:30,875
Get down!

586
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:59,737
Dubov! No!

587
01:11:01,072 --> 01:11:03,366
Get out.

588
01:11:50,538 --> 01:11:52,957
Dubov!

589
01:11:57,003 --> 01:12:00,465
Now, give me your hand.

590
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:02,842
Come on.

591
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:05,470
You can do it.

592
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:13,561
No!

593
01:12:47,136 --> 01:12:50,306
No. No.

594
01:12:50,473 --> 01:12:52,266
No!

595
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:16,184
Sean! Wait!

596
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:21,230
- What are you doing?
- Uh, l'm sorry.

597
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:26,652
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day?

598
01:14:26,778 --> 01:14:31,240
What is with you? ls this your way
of just not dealing with this morning?

599
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,410
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

600
01:14:35,953 --> 01:14:39,290
Sean! Sean!

601
01:14:39,415 --> 01:14:44,378
l know it's hard for you, but it's hard
for me too, and we still have to go.

602
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:15,451
Happy birthday, Mikey.

603
01:15:21,457 --> 01:15:25,044
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.

604
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:39,684
You turned your beeper off.

605
01:15:39,809 --> 01:15:42,478
Yes, well-- my son's birthday.

606
01:15:42,603 --> 01:15:44,981
Well, uh, here's
some poetic justice, sir.

607
01:15:45,106 --> 01:15:50,027
- Castor Troy is dead.
- He got killed trying to escape
from Erewhon.

608
01:15:50,153 --> 01:15:53,489
Where's his body?
l-l wanna see his body.

609
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:58,411
- lt hasn't been recovered yet.
- lt hasn't been recovered yet?

610
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:01,164
Get the LAPD on this!

611
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:04,625
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't
stupid enough to come back to the city.

612
01:16:07,545 --> 01:16:12,008
You must-- You must trust me.
He's already here.

613
01:16:55,259 --> 01:16:57,095
County General.
How may l direct your call?

614
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,388
Dr Archer, please.
lt's an emergency.

615
01:16:59,472 --> 01:17:02,767
- May l say who's calling?
- Her husband.

616
01:17:02,892 --> 01:17:05,686
Dr Archer, call on line three.

617
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:11,692
l know this sounds crazy,
but-- Shit!

618
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:15,863
- Sean?
- Eve, listen carefully.

619
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:18,449
The man you think is
your husband isn't.

620
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:20,827
- Who is this?
- Please, just listen.

621
01:17:20,952 --> 01:17:25,248
Take Jamie. Go to your mother's. Don't
tell him where you're going, just go.

622
01:17:25,331 --> 01:17:28,334
Uh, whoever you are,
don't call again.

623
01:17:38,469 --> 01:17:41,597
- Operations.
- l need Victor Lazarro immediately.

624
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:44,475
- Regarding?
- l have information about Castor Troy.

625
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,104
l'll transfer you, sir.

626
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,898
Sean Archer here. Who's calling?

627
01:17:50,982 --> 01:17:54,819
Well, if you're Sean Archer,
l guess l'm Castor Troy.

628
01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:04,620
Ah, yes.

629
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:08,082
This escaped convict is
considered extremely dangerous.

630
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:12,211
lf you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of Castor Troy--

631
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:30,354
You goddam right. Yeah!

632
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,565
This shit's so good,
gonna make your dick hard.

633
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,651
Huh? Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.

634
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,820
Dietrich.

635
01:18:39,572 --> 01:18:43,743
So you're still selling hops
and drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy.

636
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:49,499
Castor fucking Troy!

637
01:18:49,582 --> 01:18:52,251
Aw, man. You scared me, man!

638
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:55,171
All right. All right.

639
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:58,549
You know, l never should've sold
you those bombs. lt's my curse.
l can't say no to a friend.

640
01:18:58,674 --> 01:19:00,676
- You can't say no to money.
- Yeah, that's my other curse.

641
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,012
- You drug dealer.
- What's the matter?

642
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,098
- What?
- You look like you just fucked
your mother. Come on.

643
01:19:05,223 --> 01:19:08,017
Let's go relax, huh?

644
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,861
Hey!

645
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,367
- Hey, Castor.
- Oh, Castor Troy!

646
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:27,286
l don't believe this.
Castor Troy!

647
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:31,666
What are you doing?

648
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:34,210
Wanna hit?

649
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:38,297
Hey, baby. Remember me?
l'm your favourite peach.

650
01:19:40,383 --> 01:19:42,427
Oh, l thought
l was your favourite.

651
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:47,974
- You make me crazy
- Look at this guy.

652
01:19:48,057 --> 01:19:50,560
You know, you look pretty good
for a dead guy.

653
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:52,937
Hey!

654
01:19:57,733 --> 01:20:00,111
- Mescal.
- Two?
- Yeah.

655
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:05,700
So what do you wanna do?

656
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:17,170
You wanna get out
of the country?

657
01:20:17,253 --> 01:20:21,299
l'm not going anywhere.
l'm gonna get Sean Archer.

658
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:25,011
With your help.

659
01:20:25,094 --> 01:20:28,514
Okay.

660
01:20:35,772 --> 01:20:37,648
Welcome home, baby.

661
01:20:52,538 --> 01:20:54,749
How we supposed to do that?

662
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,920
He's vulnerable at home.

663
01:20:59,003 --> 01:21:02,090
No. l mean, this is
Sean Archer we're talkin' about.

664
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,759
- This isn't just some Boy Scout.
- Fitch.

665
01:21:04,884 --> 01:21:08,262
No. Besides, his house is
probably alarmed up the wazoo.

666
01:21:08,346 --> 01:21:10,515
The code is 10-19-86.

667
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,227
That's his dead son's birthday.

668
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,938
Don't it just break your heart?

669
01:21:19,315 --> 01:21:23,194
- That's brilliant.
- That's sick.

670
01:21:24,862 --> 01:21:28,658
How is it that you know
so much about Sean Archer?

671
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:32,328
Uh-- l, uh--

672
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:34,956
sleep with his wife.

673
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,380
Well.

674
01:21:56,853 --> 01:21:59,313
This is gra-- This is great.

675
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:03,901
So, once we kidnap supercop,
then what?

676
01:22:07,655 --> 01:22:09,991
Tiny...

677
01:22:10,116 --> 01:22:12,368
surgery.

678
01:22:13,745 --> 01:22:17,707
l'd like to take his--
his face--

679
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,501
off.

680
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:23,337
Yes.

681
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:25,506
Now, if you'll excuse me,

682
01:22:25,631 --> 01:22:30,887
l have to use
the little boy's wee-wee room.

683
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,685
Cas.

684
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:42,273
You wanna take his face--

685
01:22:42,398 --> 01:22:47,028
Yes. His face off.

686
01:22:47,111 --> 01:22:49,363
Eyes.

687
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:52,033
Nose. Skin.

688
01:22:52,116 --> 01:22:55,703
lt's coming off.

689
01:22:55,787 --> 01:22:57,872
The face...

690
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,210
off.

691
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,634
No more drugs
for that man.

692
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:44,252
l'm not me.

693
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:46,504
l'm me.

694
01:23:46,629 --> 01:23:48,923
Not me.
Me.

695
01:23:51,843 --> 01:23:54,429
Castor Archer.

696
01:23:55,972 --> 01:23:57,890
Castor Archer.

697
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,781
l thought you were dead.

698
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:16,659
l'm not dead.
l'm me.

699
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:22,874
No, no, no. Look. What l-- What
l'm trying to tell you, brother,

700
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:26,210
Pollux, is once we get the
full protection and resources...

701
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:29,756
of the government to help us
get rid of our rivals, right?

702
01:24:29,839 --> 01:24:32,133
Then we'll be set.

703
01:24:32,216 --> 01:24:35,261
Then maybe, just maybe, l'll
get my frickin' face back.

704
01:24:35,344 --> 01:24:38,806
Then l'll just have one jag-off
to take care of.

705
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:49,692
- Hey, where ya goin'? Where ya goin'?
- Karl, stop it.

706
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:51,736
- Maybe two. Hold on.
- Karl, stop it!

707
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:53,821
- Calm down, would ya? Calm down.
- Karl!

708
01:24:53,946 --> 01:24:55,907
Karl, my dad's home!
Let go!

709
01:24:56,032 --> 01:24:57,992
- Happy hunting. l'll catch ya later.
- Stop it!

710
01:24:58,117 --> 01:25:01,871
Yeah, like Mr Fuckin' lnvisible
gives a shit about you anyway.
So fuckin' hold still.

711
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,915
Calm down!

712
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:22,475
- Okay, say you're sorry.
- l'm sorry.

713
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:24,060
- l didn't hear it.
- l'm sorry!

714
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,978
- Mean it.
- l'm so sorry!

715
01:25:37,824 --> 01:25:42,912
Dress up like Halloween and
ghouls will try to get in your pants.

716
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:47,208
Typical, Dad. Some guy tries
to rape me, and l'm to blame?

717
01:26:02,598 --> 01:26:06,018
This isn't you.

718
01:26:06,102 --> 01:26:09,147
Now you haven't been the same
since Mike died.

719
01:26:09,272 --> 01:26:13,151
Hiding behind
someone else's face.

720
01:26:13,276 --> 01:26:16,904
Hoping you wouldn't
feel the pain.

721
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:21,743
While we're talking,
do you have protection?

722
01:26:21,826 --> 01:26:23,578
What? You mean
like condoms?

723
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:31,314
Protection.

724
01:26:33,483 --> 01:26:37,779
Next time, let Karl
take his pants down.

725
01:26:37,863 --> 01:26:41,491
Slip this in his thigh, twist
it so the wound won't close.

726
01:26:54,337 --> 01:26:56,798
Now go on.
Get outta here.

727
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:04,389
l am the king.

728
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:14,816
Eve.

729
01:27:19,946 --> 01:27:22,324
Jesus, Cas!
lt's me!

730
01:27:24,075 --> 01:27:26,036
lt's me.

731
01:27:27,537 --> 01:27:30,999
Cas. Shh.

732
01:27:31,082 --> 01:27:36,421
Come on.
lt's me. Jesus.

733
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:41,510
Come on.

734
01:27:41,593 --> 01:27:44,721
- Don't you wanna talk?
- The only talk l ever heard
from you is...

735
01:27:44,846 --> 01:27:47,933
"Suck my tongue," "l love
your ass," and "See ya,"

736
01:27:48,058 --> 01:27:51,186
and "Take the filthy shit off,"
"Put this on and get outta here."

737
01:27:51,311 --> 01:27:54,356
- No, l'm not goin' anywhere.
- Oh, really?

738
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:56,274
What do you-- What do you
expect me, after all this time--

739
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:59,361
Just to-- Just to
jump on you?

740
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:01,530
- That's not what l--
- ls that what you expect?

741
01:28:01,613 --> 01:28:03,448
- That's not what l meant.
- What did you mean?

742
01:28:03,573 --> 01:28:07,035
- l meant--
- Huh? ls this what you meant?

743
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:10,664
That? That? How about this?
ls that good? Huh?

744
01:28:17,379 --> 01:28:19,214
- Sean Archer.
- Bro.

745
01:28:19,339 --> 01:28:22,384
Well, l figured he might drop in
on some of our old friends.

746
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:26,763
And if my eyes don't deceive,
l think this fellow's
beginning to enjoy being you.

747
01:28:27,931 --> 01:28:29,808
Good.

748
01:28:36,648 --> 01:28:40,152
Look, look, look. Okay.
L-Look, Sasha.

749
01:28:41,903 --> 01:28:45,323
What l meant is, uh, that
l'm not going anywhere...

750
01:28:45,448 --> 01:28:48,201
until your brother
helps me, uh, first.

751
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:54,166
Cas. lf the FBl finds out
that you were here,

752
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:56,960
l'll lose my son.

753
01:28:57,085 --> 01:28:58,962
Please, Cas,
you just gotta go.

754
01:29:05,552 --> 01:29:08,555
l've said and done some things
that have made your life harder.

755
01:29:08,638 --> 01:29:11,266
- l know.
- How would you?

756
01:29:11,349 --> 01:29:13,768
When you left,
you never looked back.

757
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:15,770
l-- l just know.

758
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:31,786
Look, Sasha, l'm not
the same person you remember.

759
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:34,331
And for what it's worth,
l'm sorry.

760
01:29:40,712 --> 01:29:43,340
- They're nice-looking clothes.
- Yeah, of course. They're yours.

761
01:29:43,465 --> 01:29:46,259
Look, l know, l--

762
01:29:46,343 --> 01:29:48,512
just like 'em.

763
01:29:49,763 --> 01:29:53,475
That's a nice-lookin' kid too.

764
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,977
Yeah. Of course.

765
01:29:57,854 --> 01:30:00,148
He's yours too.

766
01:30:19,251 --> 01:30:21,753
- How old is he?
- Five.

767
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:26,007
Nobody knows he's yours.
l was...

768
01:30:26,132 --> 01:30:29,594
scared someone would try
to hurt him just to hurt you.

769
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:32,389
Adam. Adam.

770
01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:35,851
Don't want you playing with those
things. They are very, very dangerous.

771
01:30:35,976 --> 01:30:40,230
Okay? Now come on, sweetie.

772
01:30:40,355 --> 01:30:44,276
l want you to meet
your father.

773
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:47,737
Look at him.
lt's okay. Say hi.

774
01:30:47,863 --> 01:30:49,739
Hi.

775
01:31:06,047 --> 01:31:08,592
Hi.

776
01:31:12,137 --> 01:31:15,056
Michael.

777
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:18,185
- Michael. Michael?
- Cas.

778
01:31:18,268 --> 01:31:21,396
- Cas. Cas, you're scaring him.
- Michael?

779
01:31:21,521 --> 01:31:24,399
Let him go.

780
01:31:24,524 --> 01:31:27,277
What is the matter
with you?

781
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:32,782
Get down!

782
01:31:44,085 --> 01:31:46,671
Okay, Red Team!
Red Team, break off!

783
01:31:46,796 --> 01:31:50,217
How'd you get to be so brave?
How'd you get to be so brave?

784
01:31:52,886 --> 01:31:54,930
- Come out now with your hands up!
- Put these on.

785
01:31:55,013 --> 01:31:58,225
Okay. That's a good idea,
baby. Listen to your music.

786
01:31:58,308 --> 01:31:59,935
- Come on.
- Come out now!

787
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,479
Somewhere

788
01:32:02,604 --> 01:32:04,272
- Go! Go! Go!
- We have a warrant for your arrest!

789
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:08,652
Cops.

790
01:32:10,904 --> 01:32:13,740
l hate cops.

791
01:32:13,824 --> 01:32:16,326
Come on, kid.

792
01:32:23,834 --> 01:32:28,129
- Move! Move!
- Go left, left!
First door to the right!

793
01:32:33,552 --> 01:32:35,053
Go! Go! Go!

794
01:32:36,346 --> 01:32:37,848
Go! Go!

795
01:32:50,735 --> 01:32:53,655
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

796
01:32:53,738 --> 01:32:56,783
- And wake up--
- Let's get outta here! Come on.

797
01:32:57,868 --> 01:32:59,578
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

798
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,926
Damn, my place
is gettin' fucked up.

799
01:33:25,228 --> 01:33:26,855
Take him.

800
01:33:36,573 --> 01:33:39,242
Cas! Cas,
give me the boy!

801
01:33:42,829 --> 01:33:46,458
Really? Really?
Come on! Shit!

802
01:33:48,293 --> 01:33:50,837
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

803
01:33:57,302 --> 01:33:59,221
Cas, be careful
with him!

804
01:34:09,105 --> 01:34:12,859
- Don't be scared, All right? All right?
- Somewhere

805
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:18,865
Over the rainbow

806
01:34:18,949 --> 01:34:24,913
Skies are blue

807
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:30,752
And the dreams

808
01:34:30,836 --> 01:34:34,965
That you dared to dream

809
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:41,304
Really do come true

810
01:34:41,429 --> 01:34:45,267
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

811
01:34:45,392 --> 01:34:48,311
And wake up
where the clouds

812
01:34:48,436 --> 01:34:52,107
- Are far behind
- Adam!

813
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:55,735
Me

814
01:34:56,778 --> 01:35:03,910
Birds fly over the rainbow

815
01:35:03,994 --> 01:35:07,122
Why then, oh, why

816
01:35:07,205 --> 01:35:11,459
Can't l

817
01:35:11,543 --> 01:35:14,171
Adam! Adam!

818
01:35:15,463 --> 01:35:18,216
Get him out back!
Go, go, go!

819
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,638
Put the boy down.

820
01:35:23,763 --> 01:35:26,475
Honey, sweetie,
don't touch that.

821
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,143
lt isn't nice!

822
01:35:28,268 --> 01:35:30,312
l don't ever
wanna see you do that.

823
01:35:33,565 --> 01:35:36,109
They're like cockroaches!

824
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:38,153
Hey. Drop it.

825
01:35:39,654 --> 01:35:41,573
That's it.

826
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:45,577
Buzz.

827
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,162
Hey!

828
01:35:52,292 --> 01:35:54,336
Told him
not to fuck with me.

829
01:36:40,715 --> 01:36:42,676
Take the boy
and get outta here.

830
01:36:42,759 --> 01:36:44,678
- Are you all right?
- Go!

831
01:36:49,683 --> 01:36:51,810
Hurry up.

832
01:36:57,232 --> 01:37:00,193
Hey, man.

833
01:37:00,318 --> 01:37:02,946
We had some good times,
didn't we?

834
01:37:37,814 --> 01:37:42,235
l don't know what l hate
wearing worse:

835
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,571
your face or your body.

836
01:37:46,823 --> 01:37:49,242
l mean, l enjoy
boning your wife,

837
01:37:49,326 --> 01:37:51,286
but, uh, well,
let's face it.

838
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:55,665
We both like it better
the other way, yes?

839
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:57,792
So why don't we just
trade back.

840
01:37:57,918 --> 01:38:00,253
You can't give back
what you've taken from me.

841
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:06,426
Oh, well.
Plan "B."

842
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:08,595
Let's just kill each other.

843
01:40:11,843 --> 01:40:15,430
Sir, why are you
so upset?

844
01:40:15,555 --> 01:40:18,016
lt's just Pollux Troy.

845
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:50,549
Sir, look. You're
on the cover of Time.

846
01:40:50,674 --> 01:40:52,801
Listen. "ln a single week,
Agent Sean Archer...

847
01:40:52,884 --> 01:40:55,095
"has ordered a stunning series
of blitzkrieg-style raids...

848
01:40:55,178 --> 01:40:58,849
"on the hideouts, staging grounds and
safe houses of our nation's assassins.

849
01:40:58,974 --> 01:41:00,976
Car bombs--"

850
01:41:04,729 --> 01:41:08,483
Sean. Look we're friends,
so l'm gonna tell you face to face.

851
01:41:08,567 --> 01:41:11,319
l don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.

852
01:41:11,444 --> 01:41:15,740
After last night's bloodbath,
l'm terminatin' your war on terrorists.

853
01:41:20,537 --> 01:41:25,500
ls that, uh, because l'm getting
all the kudos and you're not?

854
01:41:25,584 --> 01:41:28,170
Jesus Christ. l don't know where
you're gettin' your intelligence.

855
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:32,424
lt's not from field agents.
Sometimes l think you know too much.

856
01:41:32,549 --> 01:41:34,593
Washington's
starting to worry.

857
01:41:34,718 --> 01:41:39,014
Justice wants a hearing.
Shoot.

858
01:41:39,097 --> 01:41:42,100
They're concerned
about the constitutionality
of your gestapo tactics!

859
01:41:42,225 --> 01:41:44,603
And frankly,
so am l! l'm--

860
01:41:47,022 --> 01:41:49,065
Uh, okay, Victor,

861
01:41:49,191 --> 01:41:53,028
l'll give the, uh,
taxpayers a break.

862
01:41:53,153 --> 01:41:55,113
But, um,

863
01:41:57,407 --> 01:42:00,702
l have something, uh,
l want to confess.

864
01:42:00,827 --> 01:42:03,997
And l don't think
you're gonna like it.

865
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,500
l am Castor Troy.

866
01:42:17,677 --> 01:42:20,680
- Kimmy. Kim?
- Yes, sir.

867
01:42:20,764 --> 01:42:24,100
Call the paramedics. Victor
Lazarro's had a heart attack.

868
01:42:24,226 --> 01:42:26,394
- Oh, God. Right away.
- Thank you.

869
01:42:52,254 --> 01:42:54,172
Home.

870
01:43:17,696 --> 01:43:19,614
Eve.

871
01:43:22,033 --> 01:43:23,869
Eve.

872
01:43:23,952 --> 01:43:26,621
No. Honey, please,
please don't scream.

873
01:43:26,705 --> 01:43:28,623
Don't scream.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

874
01:43:28,707 --> 01:43:31,334
Okay, just don't,
don't, don't, don't.

875
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:33,545
Just don't--
don't look at my face.

876
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:36,840
And the voice.
Don't listen.

877
01:43:36,923 --> 01:43:40,135
- Just--
- l know who you are!
You killed our son!

878
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,888
l did not kill our son.

879
01:43:43,013 --> 01:43:44,890
l'm Sean.

880
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:52,856
The last time l saw you...

881
01:43:52,939 --> 01:43:54,941
was in this room.

882
01:43:55,066 --> 01:43:58,695
We had a fight when l said
l had to go away again.

883
01:43:58,778 --> 01:44:01,865
And l spent the night
in Mike's old bed.

884
01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:17,631
l'm tired, Eve.

885
01:44:17,756 --> 01:44:22,344
The assignment was to enter
a federal prison as Castor Troy.

886
01:44:22,469 --> 01:44:25,430
lt's just fucking insane.

887
01:44:25,514 --> 01:44:29,601
And it's-- A special ops
surgeon, uh, gave me, uh,

888
01:44:29,726 --> 01:44:31,728
Castor's face!

889
01:44:34,481 --> 01:44:38,151
Then, uh-- And then, somehow,
Castor came out of his, uh,

890
01:44:39,945 --> 01:44:44,616
his-his coma, and
he killed everybody...

891
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,952
who knew about the mission.

892
01:44:47,077 --> 01:44:50,831
But, but not before
transforming into me.

893
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:16,690
l know you don't believe a word
l'm saying. Well, here's proof, Doctor.

894
01:45:16,815 --> 01:45:20,652
Your husband, me, my,
Sean's blood type is O-negative.

895
01:45:20,777 --> 01:45:23,488
Castor's is AB.

896
01:45:32,789 --> 01:45:35,417
And l love you.

897
01:45:49,389 --> 01:45:51,308
Get some backup.

898
01:45:55,937 --> 01:45:58,482
What a day.

899
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:04,654
You look tense.

900
01:46:09,034 --> 01:46:13,371
l know l've been acting
different lately. Strange.

901
01:46:14,873 --> 01:46:18,585
l've got a confession
to make, Eve.

902
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:21,713
You're not gonna like it.

903
01:46:21,796 --> 01:46:25,258
Oh, Eve. l feel--
l feel so close to you.

904
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,180
l read your diary. l know
l shouldn't have. l'm ashamed.

905
01:46:30,263 --> 01:46:32,349
But l did.

906
01:46:32,432 --> 01:46:35,060
l just wanna be the man
that you deserve--

907
01:46:35,185 --> 01:46:37,771
passionate, tender.

908
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,654
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

909
01:46:45,779 --> 01:46:48,615
My mentor, gone.

910
01:46:49,991 --> 01:46:52,452
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

911
01:46:55,205 --> 01:46:57,999
l hope this doesn't mean
l'm losing you.

912
01:46:58,124 --> 01:47:00,001
Of course not.

913
01:47:07,926 --> 01:47:10,554
You're the only family
l've got.

914
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,814
Oh, God.

915
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:11,448
- Oh, God.
- l was hoping you'd come here.

916
01:48:11,531 --> 01:48:14,284
Thank you for trusting me.

917
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:22,125
Right now,
l don't trust anyone.

918
01:48:22,209 --> 01:48:25,295
Eve, wh-where'd
you get that gun?

919
01:48:25,378 --> 01:48:27,589
l took it
from my fake husband.

920
01:48:27,714 --> 01:48:30,967
Put it down.
You know l'm Sean.

921
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:34,721
Do l? Maybe Sean's
already dead, huh?

922
01:48:34,846 --> 01:48:37,766
l'm moving very slowly.

923
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:04,292
l was thinking
the other day, l--

924
01:49:04,417 --> 01:49:06,294
l remember...

925
01:49:06,419 --> 01:49:09,548
l once took a date out...

926
01:49:09,673 --> 01:49:11,758
for surf and turf,

927
01:49:11,883 --> 01:49:15,846
not knowing she was
a vegetarian.

928
01:49:15,929 --> 01:49:20,475
So she ate bread.

929
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,812
And, uh, and broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

930
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:30,735
And we, we drove around
all night,

931
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:34,865
uh, looking for a--
for a all-night dentist.

932
01:49:34,948 --> 01:49:38,493
And, and he, uh--
He was so drunk,

933
01:49:38,618 --> 01:49:41,163
he fixed the wrong tooth.

934
01:49:47,127 --> 01:49:50,755
And it-- When l
finally brought her home--

935
01:49:53,967 --> 01:49:59,347
Even though it must have
hurt like hell,

936
01:49:59,473 --> 01:50:03,059
you, you, you kissed me.

937
01:50:14,863 --> 01:50:18,533
Sean,

938
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:22,496
that man--

939
01:50:22,621 --> 01:50:25,916
You know we've been living
together as man and wife for a week.

940
01:50:25,999 --> 01:50:28,835
Yeah, l--

941
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:33,590
l know.
Eve. Eve.

942
01:50:33,673 --> 01:50:36,635
l put you
in that position and, and--

943
01:50:36,718 --> 01:50:39,471
l-l-l can never
make it up to you.

944
01:50:46,353 --> 01:50:49,022
Well, you're damn well
gonna try.

945
01:50:49,147 --> 01:50:51,983
Let me take a look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

946
01:50:59,574 --> 01:51:01,827
With Lazarro out of the way,

947
01:51:01,952 --> 01:51:04,996
Castor's the new acting director
of the Bureau.

948
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,333
- He's untouchable.
- Not tomorrow.

949
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:10,627
Tomorrow he'll
be at Victor's service.

950
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:14,339
Tomorrow.

951
01:51:14,422 --> 01:51:16,842
That will be the day.

952
01:51:20,512 --> 01:51:23,098
l want you and Jamie away from
there. Give him a good excuse.

953
01:51:23,181 --> 01:51:25,100
l can cover for Jamie,

954
01:51:25,225 --> 01:51:27,352
but if l'm not coming he's
gonna know that something's up.

955
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:31,982
And besides, l'm the only one
who can try and explain the truth.

956
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:36,945
Excuse me, Mr Archer.
May l help you?

957
01:51:37,028 --> 01:51:39,197
Dr Levine to X Ray.

958
01:51:51,168 --> 01:51:53,753
Sean, what are you
doing here?

959
01:51:59,176 --> 01:52:01,928
Sorry, darling, it--

960
01:52:02,053 --> 01:52:05,515
l just get so,
so jealous, l--

961
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,310
l mean, wh-wh-what is a guy
to think when his, uh,

962
01:52:08,393 --> 01:52:10,312
his wife runs off
in the middle of the night?

963
01:52:10,395 --> 01:52:13,648
That l'm a doctor that's on call,
so please let me get back to work, okay?

964
01:52:13,732 --> 01:52:15,650
Sorry.

965
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:23,241
Lies, distrust,
mixed messages.

966
01:52:23,366 --> 01:52:25,285
This is turning
into a real marriage.

967
01:52:45,931 --> 01:52:49,810
How's Adam?

968
01:52:49,935 --> 01:52:53,271
l took him over to my cousin's
until this whole thing blows over.

969
01:52:53,396 --> 01:52:55,899
- Where's Jamie?
- That's what l'd like to know.

970
01:52:55,982 --> 01:52:58,777
She stole $50 from my purse
and took off.

971
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:05,242
- So what's the next move?
- This isn't your fight.

972
01:53:05,367 --> 01:53:08,912
Oh, come on. You're surprised?
Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

973
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:11,456
You think she gives a damn
about your boss?

974
01:53:17,128 --> 01:53:21,258
He killed my brother. l'm not
gonna let him take you too.

975
01:53:35,981 --> 01:53:40,777
Whatever happens,
l promise...

976
01:53:40,861 --> 01:53:43,572
Sean Archer is
off your back for good.

977
01:53:57,294 --> 01:54:01,214
My dear friends, we are here
to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.

978
01:55:32,973 --> 01:55:35,559
Somebody back there asked me
to give this to you.

979
01:55:57,789 --> 01:56:00,417
ln peace now, let us take
our brother Victor...

980
01:56:00,542 --> 01:56:02,627
to his place of rest.

981
01:56:49,299 --> 01:56:51,343
lsn't this religious?

982
01:56:54,513 --> 01:56:59,184
Ah, yes. The eternal battle
between good and evil,

983
01:56:59,309 --> 01:57:01,186
saint and sinner.

984
01:57:01,311 --> 01:57:03,772
But you're still
not having any fun!

985
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,408
Honey? Honey?

986
01:57:17,953 --> 01:57:20,080
Come here.

987
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:27,337
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.

988
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:29,923
History repeats itself.

989
01:57:35,887 --> 01:57:39,516
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.

990
01:57:39,641 --> 01:57:44,271
No, you should've
left them out of it.

991
01:57:44,396 --> 01:57:47,899
Your son was an accident.
l wanted to kill you.

992
01:57:50,694 --> 01:57:53,822
But you took it
so personally.

993
01:57:53,905 --> 01:57:57,492
Why didn't you just
kill yourself or let it go?

994
01:57:57,576 --> 01:58:00,662
- No father could.
- No brother could either.

995
01:58:00,745 --> 01:58:03,748
Neither could a sister.

996
01:58:03,874 --> 01:58:05,876
Hey, baby.

997
01:58:09,254 --> 01:58:12,215
Sasha, what the fuck
are you doing here?

998
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:14,342
Gee, Archer, l guess
l'm crashing.

999
01:58:14,426 --> 01:58:19,014
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. Thanks.

1000
01:58:19,097 --> 01:58:21,224
Sasha, baby.

1001
01:58:21,349 --> 01:58:23,977
l'm Castor.
That's Archer.

1002
01:58:24,102 --> 01:58:27,022
And l'm bored.

1003
01:58:27,105 --> 01:58:30,817
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Why don't you put your guns down?

1004
01:58:37,782 --> 01:58:40,202
What a predicament!

1005
01:59:38,426 --> 01:59:40,762
Take care of our boy.

1006
01:59:42,013 --> 01:59:44,474
You love him so much.

1007
01:59:44,599 --> 01:59:47,936
Don't let him grow up
to be like us, promise?

1008
01:59:50,188 --> 01:59:52,149
- Yeah.
- Say yeah.

1009
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:23,346
Mom?

1010
02:00:42,365 --> 02:00:44,159
Jamie!

1011
02:00:49,539 --> 02:00:52,292
Jamie, don't!

1012
02:00:59,132 --> 02:01:01,468
Hello, Wanda?
Wanda, this is Eve Archer.

1013
02:01:08,767 --> 02:01:10,519
l have something
crazy to tell you.

1014
02:01:23,031 --> 02:01:26,660
lt's a capital crime to try to kill
the next big boss of the FBl, yes?

1015
02:01:26,743 --> 02:01:28,829
- Yes.
- Ah, yes.

1016
02:01:28,912 --> 02:01:31,039
- The penalty--
- What?

1017
02:01:31,164 --> 02:01:33,208
The penalty is death!

1018
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:46,721
Die. Please, God, die.

1019
02:01:46,805 --> 02:01:49,182
Hold it!

1020
02:01:49,266 --> 02:01:51,476
Good girl, Jamie!
Shoot him!

1021
02:01:51,601 --> 02:01:55,147
Honey, don't listen to him,
honey! He's not your father!
Hear my voice. l'm your father!

1022
02:01:56,648 --> 02:01:58,400
Use your eyes, Jamie.
Shoot him!

1023
02:01:58,525 --> 02:02:00,235
Don't listen to him!
Don't shoot! Just, just--

1024
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:04,281
This scumbag-- This scumbag shot
your brother, Jamie! Kill him!

1025
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:09,619
Clod.

1026
02:02:09,744 --> 02:02:13,748
No daughter of mine
would shoot so wide.

1027
02:02:13,832 --> 02:02:17,878
Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.

1028
02:02:19,588 --> 02:02:22,132
Dad, put it down.

1029
02:02:22,257 --> 02:02:26,636
Now we're gonna find out
what's in Papa's bag. Peaches.

1030
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,935
Say goodbye to Papa.

1031
02:02:36,188 --> 02:02:37,856
Jamie!

1032
02:02:44,821 --> 02:02:48,783
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie,
are you all right? Oh, my God.

1033
02:02:49,993 --> 02:02:51,745
Sir, are you okay?

1034
02:03:01,129 --> 02:03:04,257
Please, someone please tell me
what planet l'm on?

1035
02:03:19,231 --> 02:03:21,358
Get down!

1036
02:04:35,474 --> 02:04:37,100
Stop! This is the police!

1037
02:04:37,225 --> 02:04:40,479
Stop immediately or we'll
be forced to open fire!

1038
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,982
Fire! Fire!

1039
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,920
You're right, Sean.
l've misbehaved.

1040
02:09:15,003 --> 02:09:16,755
l need to be punished.

1041
02:09:22,135 --> 02:09:24,721
But remember,
every time...

1042
02:09:24,846 --> 02:09:28,266
you look in the mirror,
you'll see my face.

1043
02:09:45,367 --> 02:09:47,661
Die!

1044
02:10:06,012 --> 02:10:08,723
Ready

1045
02:10:08,849 --> 02:10:12,435
Ready for the big ride

1046
02:10:12,561 --> 02:10:15,188
Baby

1047
02:10:19,442 --> 02:10:22,028
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

1048
02:10:29,452 --> 02:10:31,496
You okay, Archer?

1049
02:10:35,709 --> 02:10:39,004
- What did you call me?
- He called you Archer, sir.

1050
02:10:53,101 --> 02:10:58,273
Sean, they're bringing in
their top surgical team from DC.
You're going to be okay.

1051
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:47,989
When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

1052
02:11:48,114 --> 02:11:50,784
just the way it was.

1053
02:11:52,494 --> 02:11:57,874
My scar.
The one near my heart.

1054
02:11:57,999 --> 02:12:00,794
This old bullet wound.

1055
02:12:00,919 --> 02:12:03,338
- l won't need it any more.
- Okay.

1056
02:13:01,646 --> 02:13:04,816
Dad?

1057
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:19,581
Dad?

1058
02:13:19,706 --> 02:13:23,168
l'm sorry l shot you.

1059
02:13:31,426 --> 02:13:34,846
l've got something
l have to ask both of you.

1060
02:13:45,524 --> 02:13:48,235
This is, um, Adam.

1061
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:52,405
And he needs
a place to live.

1062
02:13:52,531 --> 02:13:57,327
Hi. My name's Jamie.

1063
02:13:57,452 --> 02:14:01,248
l'm Adam.

1064
02:14:01,331 --> 02:14:03,708
Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

1065
02:14:03,792 --> 02:14:07,045
Come on.

1066
02:14:07,129 --> 02:14:09,047
Okay.
